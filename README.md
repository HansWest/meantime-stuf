# Meantime Stuf

## GitHub Pages

To enable GitHub Pages:

1. Open the repository on GitHub.
2. Go to Settings -> Pages.
3. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
4. Save and wait for the published URL.

The site will be available at:

- https://hanswest.github.io/meantime-stuf/

Direct links once Pages is live:

- https://hanswest.github.io/meantime-stuf/work-flow.html
- https://hanswest.github.io/meantime-stuf/protocollen/ehbo.html
- https://hanswest.github.io/meantime-stuf/protocollen/incidenten-protocol.html
- https://hanswest.github.io/meantime-stuf/protocollen/toegang-polsbandjes.html

## Structure

- Root index: `index.html`
- Documents: `work-flow.md` and `protocollen/*.md`

When Pages is enabled, Markdown files can be viewed as HTML by using the same path with `.html`.
Example: `work-flow.html`.
